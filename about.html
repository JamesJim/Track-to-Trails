						<h3>Welcome to Track to Trails!</h3>
						<p>Let's face it - Most of us need to lead healthier and more active lifestyles. The good news is that there's an entire world out there just waiting for us to go play in and explore! </p>
						<p>Whether you prefer to walk, run, hike, cycle, play sports, or something else, it doesn't matter!  What DOES matter is that you get moving!  So, get inspired, go outside, get active, and enjoy the process and the results!

						<h3>About TRACK to TRAILS</h3>
						<img src="Images/Crater-Lake.jpg" alt="view of Crater Lake National Park" height="170" width="330">
						<h4>HELLO!</h4>

						<p>Inspiring others sometimes means leading by example and that is the goal of this blog. I'm on a mission to get back to being in the best shape of my life and I want to take you with me! </p>

						<p>For me, my peak physical condition was reached back in 2011 when I ran my first marathon (and so far, only marathon). Since then I've dealt with successive minor injuries that have lead me towards a less-active lifestyle and a less-than-ideal diet.</p>

						<p>Recently I was dealt a major wakeup call when my ultimate frisbee team was up against YOUTH teams in an out-of-town tournament.  I can't speak for the rest of the team because they're all in better shape than I am, but those kids RAN. ALL. OVER. ME. (I'm in my 30's, just for reference. And where the heck was Ultimate when I was their age?) Obviously I'm kidding about the seriousness of the situation (and we had a GREAT time at the tournament) but it's inspired me to start on my journey to get back to where I was not all that long ago.</p>
						
						<p>My awesome parents introduced us kids to a lot of different sports and activities when we were young so I now reap the benefit of being able to get into a lot of different things (even though expert-level status is nowhere in sight!). By following me through the blog and social media you'll notice a wide spread of activities (especially in the Summer) but the goal is simply to make a conscious effort to just do SOMETHING every day. No excuses.</p>

						<p>SO, you guys are going to keep me honest! If I miss a day, call me out! Hopefully my success will inspire some of you to do something similar. I'll be spending some quality time at the several local running tracks and posting photos of some of the most beautiful scenery you can find in the world from hikes in the region.</p>

						<p>It's my sincere hope that you enjoy following along!</p>
